# control_your_custom_robotic_arm_with_python
This is the continuation of project [import_your_custom_urdf_package_to_ROS-main](https://github.com/ageofrobotics/import_your_custom_urdf_package_to_ROS-main.git)
The ROS Package folders "movit_robot_arm_sim" and "robot_arm_urdf" are the same to the ones which are rovided in the project [import_your_custom_urdf_package_to_ROS-main](https://github.com/ageofrobotics/import_your_custom_urdf_package_to_ROS-main.git)

In this project, we have created a new folder named "scrpits" in the ""movit_robot_arm_sim", which contains different python scripts to control the robotics arm.

- **If you have followed the project [import_your_custom_urdf_package_to_ROS-main](https://github.com/ageofrobotics/import_your_custom_urdf_package_to_ROS-main.git) then follow the steps given in the video tutorial of each python script:**
  - Create a folder named "scripts" in you already existing "movit_robot_arm_sim" package
  - Then you can manuaaly download the python files given in the folder "movit_robot_arm_sim/scripts" in this repository and copy it in your local package folder "movit_robot_arm_sim/scripts"
- **If you have not followed the last project and want to directly start with this project, you can clone this whole repository in your catkin workspace**
  
The various python files created in this project and their video tutorial links are given below:
1. Print the End Effector Link Position and Joint Angle values of your robotic arm using Python Script
2. Move your robotic arm to predefined poses using Python Script
